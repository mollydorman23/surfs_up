## Overview of the analysis: 

The purpose of this analysis is to look at weather trends for Oahu, Hawaii, in order to determine if it would be a good market to open a surf and ice cream shop. In our first round of analysis, we looked at the precipitation and temperature data for Aug. 23, 2016 to Aug. 23, 2017. For this round of analysis, we focused on pulling up the temperatures for June and December through the full dataset (2010-2017). This should indicate whether or not the business would be viable year-round, or if it would be impacted by seasonal demand trends.

## Results:

* June temperatures do not have a large range, which makes it a relatively temperate climate.

* The min temperature for June is 64 and the max is 85, which is within the range of acceptable temperatures to eat ice cream and/or go surfing.

*  December also doesn’t have a large range of different temperatures, which tells us the weather is temperate that time of year as well.

*  The minimum temperature for December is 56 and the high is 83. However, it’s rare to see the weather in the 50s or low 60s and the average is 71. This tells us that surfing and eating ice cream would be popular in December as well, especially amongst tourists visiting from colder climates during the holidays.

## Summary: A high-level summary of the results and additional queries I would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.

The results from June and December, as well as the overall temps for Aug 23, 2016-Aug 23, 2017 make it clear: Oahu has a temperate climate that would be ideal for someone opening a surf and ice cream shop. They would be able to sustain year-round business and could flex into surf supplies or ice cream more, depending on the time of year and the demand, without having to drastically reduce or close either side of the business. 

There are four other queries I would do to round out our analysis and ensure we were making a strong business case for our surf + ice cream business:

1. Precipitation amounts for June
2. Precipitation amounts for December

I would also want to look at precipitation and weather side by side for a couple other months when Americans frequently take vacations (March for Spring Break and August for Summer break) 

3. Temperatures + precipitation for March
4. Temperatures + precipitation for August
